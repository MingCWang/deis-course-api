We\u2019ll treat the category of \u201cdiva\u201d expansively \u2013 encompassing opera singers and pop stars, composers and castrati \u2013 and engage with thorny questions of gender, sexuality, race, class, and power, in hopes of understanding the enduring cultural potency of this compelling and problematic figure.

But most human mental activity is not theoretical, but practical; less concerned with how the world is than with what is to be done. In the earliest moments of Western philosophy, Socrates distinguished himself by asking, \"How should one live?\" Increasingly, however, that question and its variants have taken a back seat in philosophy, abandoned to the best-seller lists and to publications produced by recent graduates of assertiveness training workshops. We reclaim these questions and take them up again from within the discipline of philosophy itself. Questions asked include: \"How should I live?\" \"What are the good things in life?\" \"Does life have meaning?\" Readings include Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud, Murdoch, Dennett, Dawkins, Hacking, Nozick, and Nagel. Usually offered every third year."

However, when comparing humans with the rest of the animal world, are we really so different? In this course, we will examine through discussion and writing the degree to which human morality is grounded in our evolutionary past. We will explore the development of human morality during childhood and adulthood through the lens of evolution and will look at classic scientific tests of morality/ethics (e.g., the trolley problem). Additionally, we will engage with evidence for morality in non-human species and probe the degree to which our primate relatives engage in altruistic, empathetic, and moral behaviors. During the final paper, students will have the freedom to choose their own topic and to utilize interdisciplinary literature in their exploration of the nature and nurture of morality.

What is love? How does society encourage or discourage it? Who gets to fall in love and why? For many years, the study of love seemed to belong to poets, painters, singers, and playwrights. Scholars in different fields like history and anthropology avoided studying love, claiming that it was too special\u2014too personal, maybe too sacred\u2014to be a topic of reflection and analysis. Yet love is all around us. What does it mean and do? This course explores films, case studies and more to explore how love conforms to and challenges the prevailing social order and becomes a force for change or continuity. We will analyze readings about how young people living in Africa, the USA, and Asia have described and experienced love as a vital emotion within or despite the expectations they face. Later in the semester, students will research a love-related issue of their choice and may choose from texts including written narratives, ethnographies, legal studies, films, works of art, and other mediums."

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing, and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. What is love? How does society encourage or discourage it? Who gets to fall in love and why? For many years, the study of love seemed to belong to poets, painters, singers, and playwrights. Scholars in different fields like history and anthropology avoided studying love, claiming that it was too special\u2014too personal, maybe too sacred\u2014to be a topic of reflection and analysis. Yet love is all around us. What does it mean and do? This course explores films, case studies and more to explore how love conforms to and challenges the prevailing social order and becomes a force for change or continuity. We will analyze readings about how young people living in Africa, the USA, and Asia have described and experienced love as a vital emotion within or despite the expectations they face. Later in the semester, students will research a love-related issue of their choice and may choose from texts including written narratives, ethnographies, legal studies, films, works of art, and other mediums."

This course examines how capital and capitalisms are both shaped by and help to shape the cosmologies and lifeways of particular places and people. We will explore how the cosmologies of capital and its institutions of plantations, mines and markets link the world in particular ways and provoke historically-conditioned ecologies, political formations, forms of difference (such as race, caste, gender, and class), and movements of resistance or interruption.

While terms like \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201ctransgender\u201d have become useful analytics for exploring gender, sexuality, feeling, space, place, relationality, and time, the academic theories that focus on these categories have remained mostly within white, US- and European academic spaces. We invite students to trouble these analytics - that is, the categories themselves, the bodies that these analytics center, and the methods deployed in relation to these analytics - by reading diverse approaches to gender and sexuality. The semester\u2019s engagement with \u201celsewhere\u201d is divided into three units: body, place, and method. Our objective is to teach students to cultivate new ways of seeing and ultimately new theories of gender and sexuality through engaging with non-canonical perspectives.

As indicated by their name, the Mysteries come from the Greek word, mystes, which means \u201cinitiate.\u201d Membership in the Mystery Cults was based on initiation into rituals, kept secret from the outside world. We rely on the archaeological evidence, myths, and literary references to build an understanding of these cults who offered more personal and individualized experience towards death and the afterlife. In this class, we will explore Mystery Cults across the Mediterranean world, beginning in ancient Greece and ending in the Late Roman Empire. This course provides an exploration of ancient religion its art, architecture, belief systems, origins, and evolution, as well as understanding it in its socio-political and cultural context. Usually offered every third year."

It is more than just good intentions, charisma, a personal gift, or features of a person; it is about impact, serving justice, positive values and the community; it must be done right. When it is exercised properly, the good must ensue for most of all, while empowering the voiceless, the weak, the least privileged, the most at risk, the disenfranchised. That is why this course is not interested merely in a leadership that is just another word for power at any cost, just an instrument for any cause. All together, the class will be spotting responsible leadership, where the solutions of women and men of power respond to the problems of the people, to whom they are accountable for.

Crime narratives have served a variety of purposes throughout American History. During the Colonial and Early Republican period, published execution confessions and sermons communicated the perils of criminal activity. Sensationalized accounts of cases such as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 and the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, \u201cThe Black Daliah,\u201d helped sell millions of newspapers. Truman Capote\u2019s In Cold Blood transformed true crime into a literary art form. Today, fans of true crime can find entire television networks and podcasts devoted to the subject. True crime is entertainment\u2014but what does that tell us about American culture? How does the genre shape our view of the justice system and the nature of crime itself? Is there anything \u201ctrue\u201d about True Crime?

We typically assume that human attraction (and love) is much more nuanced and complex ... but is it? Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures\u2014such as low body weight\u2014actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived? For the final essay, students will supplement library research with data collection to produce an interdisciplinary research paper. Usually offered every year."

Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures\u2014such as low body weight\u2014actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived? For the final essay, students will supplement library research with data collection to produce an interdisciplinary research paper. Usually offered every year."

The development of social media, now so important in our lives, has caused huge changes in popular culture. It is now more democratic, more diverse, more open, and more political than ever before. Still, some of the same old problems persist. As noted intellectual Mary Beard argues, \u201cthere are countless examples of attempts to write women entirely out of public discourse.\u201d Another prominent woman, lyricist, artist, businesswoman, and philanthropist Taylor Swift calls out this issue in simpler terms: \u201cwhen everyone believes ya, what\u2019s that like?\u201d Beard and Swift both raise the same central question: who is allowed to speak in public, and who is believed? Furthermore, why do we see figures in popular culture as more or less credible than one another? What kind of identities (race, gender, or class) and social messages are involved in this process of divining the truth from multiple people\u2019s perspectives?

Sugar and sweeteners have played a large role in influencing human societies. From its earliest origins as an exotic substance to its commodification and democratization at the hands of capitalism, sugar has shaped empires, fueled systems of slavery, and revolutionized the human diet. Even today, this commodity continues to shape our cultures, our vocabularies, our diets, our health, and our environment in surprisingly pervasive ways. Why and how has this seemingly ordinary substance had such an impact upon our lives, and how can we constructively manage and responsibly enjoy it in the global future? In this course, we will examine its nature and the complex history of human interactions with this sweet commodity through film, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, poetry, novels, blogs, and art. We will also engage with current debates over how to manage its public health and environmental impacts and how to remedy the injustices that still accompany its production.

National identity plays a key factor in performances and can spark controversy, unity, or both. How can Eurovision help us understand the evolving role and significance of national identity? What is national identity and how is it used? What shapes, extends, and limits identity and how does this intersect with the nation? In this course we will look at some theories about nations and national identity, examine the performative aspects of identity, and, of course, enjoy some performances from the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest.

Through reading a novel or short story from popular culture or the ancient world, watching a television episode of Friends or Black Mirror, or critically examining a movie like Toy Story or Clueless, we will seek answers to questions like: What are the benefits of friendship? What role does gender play in friendship? What do friendship-depictions tell us about how audiences view and participate in friendship?

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors.

The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies? How can storytelling bring about organizational change? Which traits do storytellers and business leaders share? What is the connection between storytelling and leadership?

How do we define our relationship with animals: which we keep as livestock, which we keep as pets, and which we keep in zoos? Human-animal interactions have developed over hundreds of thousands of years; in that time, animals have had a significant impact on human behavior and on the development of human societies. In this class, we will explore the deep history of the relationship between humans and animals. We will consider how different cultures and subsistence strategies cultivate different interspecies dynamics, and particularly how domestication changes the way we perceive animals and their place in the world. To explore these questions, we will use multiple lines of evidence, including ethnographic data, material culture, and scientific analyses of faunal remains. Students will have the opportunity to research and write about the relationship between humans and animals in a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures. Usually offered every year."

What is love? How does society encourage or discourage it? Who gets to fall in love and why? For many years, the study of love seemed to belong to poets, painters, singers, and playwrights. Scholars in different fields like history and anthropology avoided studying love, claiming that it was too special\u2014too personal, maybe too sacred\u2014to be a topic of reflection and analysis. Yet love is all around us. What does it mean and do? This course explores films, case studies, and more to explore how love conforms to and challenges the prevailing social order and becomes a force for change or continuity. We will analyze readings about how people living in Africa, the USA, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have described and experienced love as a vital emotion within or despite the expectations they face. Students will research a love-related issue of their choice and may choose from texts including written narratives, ethnographies, legal studies, films, works of art, novels, and other mediums.

However, these identities have not vanished; in fact, we might argue that they remain even more potent in today's age of constant media connection. We will explore feminist theories of media, gender, sexuality, and race, as well as applying these theories to current events online.

How have the figures of the lotus blossom, the dragon lady, the trafficked woman, the geisha, the war bride, the military prostitute, the orphan, among other problematic tropes emerged to represent Asian/American women?

Most of us would agree that infrastructure should be a public thing, serve society, and allow for better life, communication, and activity. Yet infrastructures are often hidden, subterranean, and therefore prone to exploitation and hijacking. The anthropology of infrastructure aims in part at making it more visible and at deciphering the complex interaction between things, society, and politics. But anthropologists end up unearthing more than utility networks and urbanism plans. They stumble upon the very power of inanimate things to orient our experiences, from the most intimate (having sex) to the least material of them (browsing the internet). From politics to ethics and back, this course will explore our relationship to infrastructure. Usually offered every second year."

Students analyze scientific papers on a wide range of topics in the fields of biochemistry and biophysics. Discussion focuses on understanding of the scientific motivation for and experimental design of the studies. Particular emphasis is placed on making an independent determination of whether the author's conclusions are well justified by the experimental results. Students are also introduced to grant-proposal writing by preparing NIH-format mock proposals for critical discussion and evaluation. Usually offered every year."

The course will cover a range of topics focusing on viral mechanisms such as cell entry (membrane fusion and penetration), RNA replication and processing, and virus-particle assembly and budding, and the roles of these basic viral functions in permitting virus evolution. Through in-depth analyses of primary literature, a special emphasis will be placed on understanding experimental approaches and critically evaluating conclusions drawn from experiments. We will build upon various concepts covered in the course to discuss potential strategies for preventing undesired viral adaptations at the root of pandemics or antiviral drug resistance. The course will focus on recent discoveries and the use of modern techniques in virology research. Usually offered every year."

This course will address the role of how microbial interactions with other microbes (viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes), plants and humans shaped our world. Most of the times, these interactions are good, but principle of pathogenicity will also be covered. Classes will build up from basic microbiology, cell biology and evolution concepts and advance to mechanistic insights of how simple organisms can create complex ecosystems. We will discuss microbial interactions that have been known for centuries, long before any modern concept of the cell was established, the current state-of-the-art knowledge and what to expect for future discoveries. This course will also introduce the most important techniques historically used to study microbial interactions, giving emphasis to optical microscopes. Finally, students will use home-made, portable microscopes to explore the microbial world in field projects. Usually offered every year."

Indeed, despite lip service to ideas like separation of Church and state, American educational leaders long saw schools as a vehicle for promoting a Protestant inflected American culture. This course begins from the premise that American education and American religion have always existed in relationship. Religious groups have sometimes tried to use the public schools as vehicles to advance their religion, sometimes, they have created supplemental schools, and sometimes they have created whole parallel school systems. But in all cases, education and religion in American are intertwined. This course asks when education is religious and when religion is educational.

In the aftermath of the Revolution (1910-1920), Mexican muralism emerged as the platform to promote ideals of social cohesion in a ravaged nation. In the throes of building a new national consciousness, Mexican artists deployed an avant-garde aesthetic that would influence muralist movements, and the forms of social critique associated to them, across the continent. With a historical perspective, we will study how muralism\u2014an intervention of public space\u2014supports struggles for representation through time. Paying special attention to Mexican, Chicano, and American artists\u2014and to a lesser extent, Southern Cone and Caribbean artists\u2014we will study how muralism combats multiple forms of oppression while addressing timely sociopolitical concerns. The course covers works from the early twentieth century to the present. Special one-time offering, spring 2021."

As this incomplete list of various aspects of housing indicates, housing impacts people in many different ways, and this course will provide a general introduction on some of the dominant themes: Homeownership, renters, housing instability and homelessness, neighborhoods and segregation, racial and ethnic disparities, as well as the impact of housing on health, mental health, disability, the elderly.

Among animals, individuals choose mates based on biologically informative features such as long colorful tail feathers, large canines, or a red, swollen posterior. We typically assume that human attraction (and love) is much more nuanced and complex ... but is it? Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures\u2014such as low body weight\u2014actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived? For the final essay, students will supplement library research with data collection to produce an interdisciplinary research paper. Usually offered every year."

If successful, this legislation will be the culmination of years of lobbying to address the forces of classism, racism, and sexism that have contributed to the subjugation and devaluing of domestic workers and the labor they perform, including but not limited to: housekeeping, cooking, and childcare. Students will examine and develop arguments about the social, cultural, and economic conditions and systems that underpin the pervasive exploitation of domestic labor in the U.S. and abroad. By thinking about how domestic labor is imagined in literature, television, and film, students will unpack paradigms of privilege and power, and carefully consider the intersections of class, gender, and race. Usually offered every year."

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim\u2019s DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer \u2013 a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science. We will investigate the work of forensic anthropologists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as Bones, CSI, or Crossing Jordan.

We will explore questions of identity, sociology, history, culture, and aesthetics. This course will encourage us to think about questions including: How does a minority voice make itself heard by an often indifferent cultural majority? How does one politically persuade an often hostile audience? How is one\u2019s personal history and sense of identity influenced by historical, political, and cultural circumstances?

The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies? How can storytelling bring about organizational change? Which traits do storytellers and business leaders share? What is the connection between storytelling and leadership?

Finally, we will use advertising as a starting place for researching the ways popular protests emerge under consumer and corporate capitalism. This course will foster the development of incisive analysis and advanced digital literacy skills by exploring a range of primary sources, engaging in structured forum discussions, and conducting independent research.

If successful, this legislation will be the culmination of years of lobbying to address the forces of classism, racism, and sexism that have contributed to the subjugation and devaluing of domestic workers and the labor they perform, including but not limited to: housekeeping, cooking, and childcare. Students will examine and develop arguments about the social, cultural, and economic conditions and systems that underpin the pervasive exploitation of domestic labor in the U.S. and abroad. By thinking about how domestic labor is imagined in literature, television, and film, students will unpack paradigms of privilege and power, and carefully consider the intersections of class, gender, and race.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Sex Sells! It\u2019s the immortal truism of the advertising industry. But how does sex sell? For decades, advertisers have used hot bods and innuendo to suggest that power and pleasure can be bought. In the 1970s, the battle cry, \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, Baby!\u201d pushed cigarettes as the hip accessories of feminism and the sexual revolution. Today, brands blend consumerism with gender activism, invite LGBTQ to the mainstream marketplace, and tempt millennials with new promises of sex and success. In this course, students find and write about advertising that delights, infuriates, and perplexes them. In the first essay, they dissect their choice of pornographic food commercials, Budweiser bromances, and Calvin Klein billboards that titillate consumers and reshape social constructs of masculinity and femininity. The research paper challenges students to locate and comprehend recent studies of sex and gender in advertising and apply them to a defined set of ads or a major campaign of their choice. Usually offered every year."

The main topics this year will be on Machine Translation (MT) and Dialogue Systems. Historically these two topics are quite distinct in the way they are approached. However, the wide adoption of deep learning techniques in NLP has brought the two topics closer, as both can be tackled in the sequence-to-sequence framework. In this course, we will provide an overview of these topics, covering data acquisition and preparation, model development, and system evaluation.",
            "Specific to Machine Translation, we will examine statistical and neural approaches to MT, methods in creating and preparing parallel corpora to train MT systems, and metrics for MT evaluation. On the topic of dialogue systems, we will discuss rule-based, statistical, and neural approaches to chatbots and task-oriented systems. We will examine different components of a dialogue system \u2014 spoken language understanding, dialogue state tracking, and dialogue generation. The goal of the course is to help the student to either build a working prototype, or solve a problem in these areas."

It will examine the history of NER through the lens of the programs, evaluations, data sets, and advances in machine learning that have shaped research in this area, beginning with early statistical and rule-based systems and concluding with modern deep learning systems. Students will develop named entity recognition systems in Python, building their own end-to-end system NER and applying it in a project."

This course takes a fresh look at the study of literature by exploring how a variety of authors and genres confront the problem of evil in the modern world, from Elizabethan drama to graphic novels and film. We'll practice using several influential literary theories to make sense of what we read and see. Texts include the Book of Job, King Lear, Paradise Lost, Robinson Crusoe, Art Spiegelman's Maus, and Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things."

The class will be comprised of about 50% Brandeis students and 50% incarcerated students. All prospective students must meet with the professor to discuss their schedule compatibility with the course (it is a 45-minute drive from campus) and comfortability with this unconventional format before enrolling in the course. Due to COVID restrictions at the facility, the class can only currently accommodate 6 students but interested students should get on the waitlist because circumstances may change by August."

Do you remember the first newspaper article you read about an injustice in your community, or the first time that you saw an American court on television or in movies? This course sets out to examine how America and Americans came to define justice and form courts that promote fairness and equity (for some). It explores the imaginaries that surround the courts and justice, and reviews key cases in which the strength and limitations of the courts can be seen. The course then explores the roles of journalists in exposing injustices and reviews cases in which their work has been either protected or curtailed. It ends with the new legal challenges that have arisen with the age of the internet."
